# Developing

Thank you for thinking about adding new features to this Google Pub/Sub beat!

In general the steps for developing are: 

1. Read the [contributing file](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file. 
   We follow standard conventions for Github development.
2. Sign the [Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com) if you haven't already.
3. Write your code and tests.
4. Run `make pre-commit` before submitting pull-requests.
   This formats your code, tests it and updates the documentation.
5. Create a pull request.
6. That's it!

## Building

### Requirements
