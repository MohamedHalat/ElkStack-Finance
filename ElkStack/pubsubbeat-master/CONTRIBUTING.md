## Submitting code via Pull Requests

*Thanks* for considering submitting code!

- We follow the [Github Pull Request Model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
- For big changes, please create an issue outlining the feature and describing its implementation.
  This gives us a chance to review early so there's no wasted effort.
- All submissions, even by project members, require review before merging.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Everyone is welcome to try out and add comments to pull requests.
If you don't know how to do one of the steps, feel free to ping one of the repository owners and
we'll help!

We look for the following in reviews:

*Code*

- Follow Go's formatting conventions. You can auto-format using `make pre-commit`
- Blend in with the existing code, even if it's "wrong".
- Write tests.
- Refactor OR add a feature in a PR. This makes it easier to understand changes and see bugs.
  See Martin Fowler's [Workflows of Refactoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqEg37e4Mkw)
  for more information.

*Documentation*

Try to keep documentation short, easy to read and accessible to people from all backgrounds.
